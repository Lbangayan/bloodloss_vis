    <h1> Affects of Anesthesia on Blood Loss</h1>

    <p> Perhaps the greatest fear when it comes to going under the table is the blood loss you will undergo.
        Blood loss is no serious matter; excessive blood loss during a surgery can lead to postoperative
        complications like organ failure, needing blood transfusions, or sadly, even death. Specifically,
        a lot of patients wonder about what drug they take prior to the operation and how it relates to the
        amount of blood that is lost during the surgery. For those who have done surgery before, you have
        probably heard the doctor advising you not to take medication like coagulants to reduce blood loss
        prior to surgery. Certain drugs can aid with or have no effect on blood loss, while others can prove
        detrimental. In this inquiry, we take you on a journey that shows you the state of todayâ€™s preoperative
        drugs AND its relations to blood loss in patients.</p>

    <p> We trained a linear regression model based on the drugs we learned to increase blood pressure
        to see how they affect blood loss. Using this model we predict the blood loss a patient undergoes
        based on how much of each drug was administered. </p>
